# Objective
The goal of this project is to design a sales analytics solution that helps answer key business questions:
- How are sales performing overall?
- Which regions are growing profitably, and which need attention?
- Which products should be pushed, fixed, or reconsidered?
- Are discounts supporting growth or eroding profit margins?
- How is sales performance distributed across sales representatives?
The output is a focused dashboard designed to support pricing, expansion, and sales strategy decisions.

# Data Source
_What data is needed to achieve our objective?_

_Where is the data coming from?_
The dataset used in this project is from ChatGPT and represents a structured sales transactions dataset, capturing activity in 2025.

# Project Stages
This project followed a structured analytics workflow:
1. Business understanding and requirements definition
2. Data understanding and documentation
3. Data preparation and validation
4. SQL-based transformation and analysis
5. Dashboard design and development
6. Testing and validation
7. Insight generation and recommendations

# Design
## Dashboard Mock-Up
Before building the dashboard, I designed a conceptual layout to ensure:
- Clear metric hierarchy
- Minimal cognitive load
- Alignment with the Sales Manager's decision needs

The dashboard is structured into:
- Executive overview (KPIs)
- Regional performance
- Product performance
- Discount impact
- Sales representative performance

_What should it look like?_

## Tools
- Excel – data preparation, validation, exploratory analysis
- SQL – data transformation, aggregation, and business logic
- Power BI – data modeling, DAX measures, and visualization
